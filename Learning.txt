strtok vs strtok_r  
strtok visual time line
1. main(): strtok(input, ";")           → returns "ls " 
   Internal state: "remember position after first ;"

2. parse_input(): strtok(cmd_copy, " ") → returns "ls", then NULL
   Internal state: "OVERWRITTEN - now tracking space parsing"

3. main(): strtok(NULL, ";")           → returns NULL (state corrupted!)
   Should have returned " whoami" but internal state was lost
